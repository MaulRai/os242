## Week 1

* [What is virtualization?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lFnKYCZT5o){:target="_blank"} ---
  Very insightful for a basic overview of how virtual memory works. It explains why we need virtual memory.
* [The Complete Linux Course: Beginner to Power User](https://youtu.be/wBp0Rb-ZJak){:target="_blank"} ---
  Explains well the basic for Linux syntax and teaches many important CLI command keys. I like the way he progressively explain each commands while I can practice right away in my own powershell.

## Week 2

* [Cyber Security Full Course for Beginner](https://youtu.be/U_P23SqJaDc){:target="_blank"}  
  Like the assignment instruction, you should watch 30 seconds of every chapter. But you likely just CANT! Even in the beginning of each chapter of this video could hook you to an interesting history, fun facts, and many cyber security details that you just can't skip!
* [What Is Cyber Security | How It Works?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inWWhr5tnEA){:target="_blank"} 
  Pretty good depict how cybersecurity works and why it exists. It also covers a vast learning materials in PPT on this week.

## Week 3

* [How to Create a Simple Makefile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r7i5X0rXJk&ab_channel=PaulProgramming){:target="_blank"}  
  Introduction to using Makefiles, which are used to automate the build process for programs in languages like C and C++. The video demonstrates how to create a basic Makefile to streamline the compilation of code by specifying rules and dependencies. Paul explains the structure of a Makefile, including targets, prerequisites, and commands.
* [why do header files even exist?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOQZlD-0Scc){:target="_blank"}  
  Explores the purpose and necessity of header files in programming, specifically in languages like C and C++. The creator explains that header files (.h files) help organize code by separating declarations (such as function prototypes, macros, and variable definitions) from the actual implementation (in .c files).

## Week 4

* [How computer memory works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3q5zWCw8J4){:target="_blank"}
  Do you ever wonder how computer retrieve your saved data? Thanks to **memory**, now we can write something in computer and save it. This short video explains the memory in general, like how it works, memory types, advantages and drawbacks of each types, etc.
* [But, what is Virtual Memory?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9WLYbE0p-I){:target="_blank"}
  Excellent explanation of Memory Management, with a visual demonstration. Very compact and easy to understand. Great for visual learners.

## Week 5

* [C structs](https://youtu.be/oKXP1HZ8xIs?si=ulpVGxQ4cNH92Bj6){:target="_blank"}
  It's simply explain basic of structs in C, how it behave etc. Important to know to solve this week's assigment

* [What is virtual memory? â€“ Gary explains](https://youtu.be/2quKyPnUShQ?si=m2AVfDFxbcKOzfpi){:target="_blank"}
  Nice visualization for Virtual Memory in general. This video introduce you with virtual adress, lookup table, and physical memory with all the function.

---

## Week 6

* [The fork() function in C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cex9XrZCU14){:target="_blank"}
  It basically explain what is fork function does, how it turns, what it will do, and what it will return. Turns out, fork function is very important function for concurrent processing.

* [Process IDs in C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZrQ4eGm-hM&t=394s){:target="_blank"}
  The sequel of the last multiprocessing video, we are introduced to getpid() and getppid(), which return, respectively, the process ID of the child and the process ID of the parent. This video also demonstrates some cases using fork and those 2 function.

* [Waiting for processes to finish (using the wait function) in C](https://youtu.be/tcYo6hipaSA?si=Bd9dh-nNLMXdfTe3){:target="_blank"}
  Next up, we meet this special function that called wait. As the name describe, it will yield until the other process done return. This video also demonstrates some cases using wait function.

## Week 7

* [Process Synchronization](https://youtu.be/ph2awKa8r5Y?si=EvWPdcVUKuGmNC4j){:target="_blank"}
  This demonstration video will first introduce you with how cooperating processes work. But this processes have some problem, so it has the solution for it which  explained in next video.

* [The Critical-Section Problem](https://youtu.be/UtEORPakw5Y?si=9F0esyWmKpHWvQu2){:target="_blank"}
  Explain one of the problem that appears when some processes try to changing something with the same variable/file/something else. So the the solution for this is to implement critical section where no two processes are executing in their critcal sections at the same time.

## Week 8

* [6. Chapter 5: Compiling a Cross Toolchain - How to build Linux From Scratch (LFS) 12.2 - Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMdPHpPiy4Q&list=PLyc5xVO2uDsDzdT8lkx430hZ-gY69wgS3&index=7&t=7s){:target="_blank"}
  This video provides a clear, step-by-step guide on building the toolchain necessary for creating a Linux From Scratch (LFS) system. It focuses on configuring and compiling essential tools like GCC and Binutils, which are foundational for compiling a Linux environment from scratch. The tutorial is especially helpful for users looking to understand the intricacies of cross-compilation and dependencies in Linux system development.

* [Operating System #21 Scheduling in Linux: O(n), O(1) Scheduler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF3KKMI3_1s){:target="_blank"}
  This video breaks down the evolution of Linux scheduling algorithms, focusing on O(n) and O(1) schedulers. It clarifies the efficiency differences between these approaches, particularly how the O(1) scheduler optimizes task selection speed, which is crucial for enhancing system performance. This is valuable for anyone looking to grasp how Linux handles multitasking efficiently.
